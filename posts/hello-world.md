## Hello, World!

Hi there, this is simply a test post used to test the site deployment. The site is meant to be a place where I write things down for future references. 

The site is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), the posts are written using Markdown. It is then deployed to Github pages. 
It took me some time to get syntax highlighting and math display to work, so this post is meant as a display test. 

1. Syntax Highlighting

```python
# python
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

```javascript
// javascript
function helloWorld(){
    return "Hello, World!"
}
```

2. Display Euler's formula

For any real number $x$, 
$$
e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x).
$$

3. Test image insert
